ype Coercion in JavaScript 

Type Coercion refers to the process of automatic
 or implicit conversion of values from one data
  type to another. This includes conversion
   from Number to String, String to Number,
    Boolean to Number etc. when different
 types of operators are applied to the values.


 Json: 
        JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. 
        JSON is lightweight data-interchange format.

Async/Await Function in JavaScript

Promise :
Promises are used to handle asynchronous
 operations in JavaScript. They are easy to 
 manage when dealing with multiple asynchronous
  operations where callbacks can create 
callback hell leading to unmanageable code. 

Benefits of Promises 
Improves Code Readability
Better handling of asynchronous operations
Better flow of control definition in asynchronous logic
Better Error Handling

A Promise has four states: 
fulfilled: Action related to the promise succeeded
rejected: Action related to the promise failed
pending: Promise is still pending i.e. not fulfilled or rejected yet
settled: Promise has fulfilled or rejected
